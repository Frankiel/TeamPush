LoadingActivity.class - activity which is started at the beggining, there we should find out if user is logged in (before that delete onClick in ProgressBar, cause i did it just for testing (we should do verifying in onCreate method));
LoginActivity.class - it is clear;

WeAreInActivity.class - TESTING CLASS, WE DONT NEED IT cause u just was testing using it;
MainActivity.class - u will get here after u logged in so there will be out menu and all fragments ()
